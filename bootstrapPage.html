  <h1>Using computer science to aid the disabled</h1>
  <p>There are many areas that have been improved by the use of computing, one of the most important being the ability to provide aid to those with disabilities. 
     A recent example of this is the work done with Thibault, a 30 year old optician who became a quadriplegic after a 15 metre fall at a night club. With the help of Clinatec
     and the University of Grenoble, Thibault was able to control all four of his paralysed limbs with a mind-controlled "exoskeleton". The exoskeleton works by surgically 
     implanting two electrode covered pads into the patients brain, which record the patient's brain activity and transfer it to a local computer.</p>
