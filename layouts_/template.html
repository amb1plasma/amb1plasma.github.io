AN ARTICLE ON USING COMPUTER SCIENCE TO IMPROVE ACCESSIBILITY

</div>

<div class="container">

<div class='row'>

  <p>There are many areas that have been improved by the use of computing, one of the most important being the ability to provide aid to those with disabilities. 

     A recent example of this is the work done with Thibault, a 30 year old optician who became a quadriplegic after a 15 metre fall at a night club. With the help of Clinatec

     and the University of Grenoble, Thibault was able to control all four of his paralysed limbs with a mind-controlled "exoskeleton". The exoskeleton works by surgically 

     implanting two electrode covered pads into the patients brain, which records the patient's brain activity and transfer it to a local computer.</p>

	The exoskeleton is far from a finished product and still has many flaws. The first major issue is that the 

	exoskeleton requires a harness suspended from the ceiling to prevent the user from falling over, 

	which means that it cannot be used outside of the laboratory. The accuracy of the signals read by the elctrode pads

	is another area of concern: during one test Thibault was only able to succesfully touch targets 70% of the time.

	The high cost of the apparatus is another clear area of concern.
